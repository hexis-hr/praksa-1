# Document(Receipt) Digitization #
##Overview##
Web application for processing .jpeg or .pdf files for big companies and easier access to their important data like income or expenses. It is based especially for processing receipts and storing them in the cloud. This application will make life a lot easier for accountants and clerks that are dealing with a lot of papers at the moment. Firstly we will make a working project and then publish it and get big companies to use it.


##Project goals##
Our mainly focus is setting up an environment that non-IT people can use and making it intuitive to use. This is a big step ahead in removing all paper documentation that is using a lot of space and storage, especially in big companies that deal with a lot of important data. This project will leave finding certain document in a big pile of paper registers in the past. In summary, this application will extract, store and save your valuable data that you can later access with ease when you need it. It will also be able to filter through dates, prices in different currencies and product names displayed on document. You will get a stable web application that can be used over and over again without any problems, bugs and crashes as well.
